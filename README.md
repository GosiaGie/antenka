# Antenka
## REST API written in Java. 

Main goal of this project was to learn and improve:
1) ORM framework - Hibernate,

*Logging in
	-logging in by email and password
	-REST API is stateless, so after sucessful login application didn't start any session
	-client gets a valid JWT token, which is requirement for every request except "/", "auth/login" and "auth/registration"

*Adding Player Profile
	-Player Profile is requirement to find matches and slots
	-positions - one or many; required enum format: OUTSIDE_HITTER, MIDDLE_BLOCKER, RIGHT_SIDE_HITTER, SETTER, LIBERO
	-gender - one; required enum format: MALE, FEMALE
	-level - one; required enum format: BEGINNER, MEDIUM, ADVANCED
	-benefit card number - not requirement




*Searching Match
	-Two endpoints, two structure of result (bidirectional relationalship between Match and Slot
	-Results are based on a player's profile of user - only 
			1) matches with slots where user meets requirements (and other these matches' slots)
			or 
			2) only slots where user meets the requirements.
	-User without player's profile can't find and sign up to a match
	-Client sends only a maximal price
	-If user has an active benefit card, then only benefit prices are checked. If player doesn't have active benefit card, then only
	regular price are checked.
	-If match doesn't have benefit price, then for simplicity "regular price = benefit price" 
*Signing Up
	-Client sends eventID and slot number. eventID = unique identifier of a match, slot number = order number of slot in a particular
	match. Every slot gets unique ID and its order number, starting from 1.
